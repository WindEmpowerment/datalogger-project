# DIGITALs
This board contains all the needs to use an Atmega1284p like an Arduino. But because it's a prototype board, the power is a small shield to be upgradable. On this digital board, the shield can be plug.
A sd card module and a transmitter module can be add too. This permit to collect data on the SD card and/or send it by wifi or gprs.
